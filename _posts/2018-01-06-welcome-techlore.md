Hey, Techlore community, Happy New Year!

After much deliberation, I have decided to shift this group from a book club to more of a community forum. After starting Techlore as a new years resolution in 2017, I found that although many members are interested in reading more and improving their awareness of tech's effect on our communities through literature - not many have or make the time to actually read a book a month and contribute to the discussion sessions on a regular basis.

Having the community add to a [reading list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LtdfV8Wdop13PvYOZrkL4EHEsGVJKxobob7Hc5RXKcQ/edit?usp=sharing) and vote for a new book each month has allowed for a wider breadth of topics and books than I would have necessarily chosen myself.

Personally, I do feel this group has created a stronger habit for me of reading and sharing the ideas and concepts I have learned in a public forum. I am very grateful to have had an opportunity to share this experience with you.

As of 2018, my new resolution is to start sharing my writing more consistently. SO, I will be choosing a relevant book to our community and will be sharing blog posts on the topics covered in the literature with thoughts on how it affects our community and our greater society.

I encourage you to use this forum to share your own thoughts and ideas on empowerment, entrepreneurship, culture, social justice, and inclusion through the lens of technology.

Best,
